"""``Result`` — the unit of QA output.

Every QA test returns one ``Result``. The suite assembles them into a
markdown report. Keeping this dataclass small and uniform is what lets
the QA module stay minimal in code while admitting any kind of test.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name
        Short identifier (matches the test function name).
    summary
        Headline numbers a reader looks at first. Keys are descriptive
        (``"max_delta_itp"``, ``"p99"``, ``"violations"``). Floats are
        rendered to 4 significant figures in the report; ints are
        rendered as ints.
    scalar_field
        Optional per-sample scalar (one number per cube cell or per
        stimulus point), for downstream composition. Tests that already
        produce a useful viz from this field don't need to expose it,
        but exposing it lets a future test reuse the data.
    figure_path
        Path to the test's saved PNG (relative to the QA out_dir's
        report.md location), or ``None`` if the test has no figure.
    interpretation
        One sentence: what does it mean if this test fails? This is
        what makes the report legible to someone who didn't write it.
    reference_values
        Per-metric quality targets, keyed by the same metric name used
        in ``summary``. Rendered as a bulleted list under "Reference
        values" right after the figure in the report so readers can
        compare the headline numbers to a known-good range. The value
        is free-form text — typically a condition (``"≤ 2.0"``) plus a
        short justification (``"perceptual visibility threshold"``).
        Leave empty for tests that don't have established targets.
        Citations and prior art live in the test function's docstring,
        not on the ``Result`` — the bundle's QA report is for the
        bundle's numbers, not a literature review.
    passed
        ``True`` / ``False`` if a tolerance was checked, ``None`` if
        the test is purely informational. Used by the console log and
        any CI integrations; not surfaced in the bundle's QA report
        (the report instead exposes ``reference_values`` so readers
        can judge the numbers themselves).
    units
        Units string for ``summary`` values where relevant
        (``"deltaITP"``, ``"log10(cond)"``, ``"ΔE2000"``).
