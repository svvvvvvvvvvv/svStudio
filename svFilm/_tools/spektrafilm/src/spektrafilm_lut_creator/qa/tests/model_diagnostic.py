    """Pipeline response in the density domain — coupler diagnostic.

    Reads complementary to ``monotonicity``: that test measures
    "is the cube invertible?" along the centerline; this one shows
    "how do the channels interact?" by sweeping each channel against
    several constant values of the other two ("pins") and overlaying
    the resulting density curves.

    Pins are picked so the **off-diagonal curves enter each panel at
    target output densities** ``[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]``. Concretely:
    we build a fine neutral (R=G=B=t) characteristic curve from the
    LUT, invert it once to find the input codes ``t`` whose neutral
    output density equals each target D, and pin the non-swept channels
    at those codes. So in the R panel, at sweep_x=0, the G and B curves
    start near D=0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8/1.0 — the legend value matches what
    you see on the Y-axis at the left edge of the panel. (Not exact —
    pulling the swept channel to 0 perturbs the off-diagonal output via
    chemistry coupling — but well within "about", which is the point of
    the visualization.)

    The vertical spread between same-color curves at different pins is
    the **DIR coupler signature**: if the developer-inhibitor couplers
    in the film simulation are active, pushing one channel's pin level
    shifts the other channels' density response visibly; an uncoupled
    simulation would show all same-color curves stacked.

    The bottom-right panel keeps the canonical neutral (R=G=B) curve
    — the classic film D-vs-input characteristic from datasheets.

    Uses trilinear interpolation on the LUT (the LUT already encodes
    the on-grid pipeline response; we sample at the pins which may not
    align with the cube grid).
