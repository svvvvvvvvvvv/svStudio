"""Bundle-text rendering — README, cube header, README sub-blocks.

Pure formatting against :class:`BundleMeta`. No bake logic, no I/O.
Split out of :mod:`spektrafilm_lut_creator.builders` so the bake driver
stays focused on running the pipeline; consumers wanting to regenerate
the README or cube headers from an existing ``bundle.json`` can import
from here directly.

The bundle layout filenames (``README.md``, the LUT license) live here
as canonical constants — builders.py imports them when writing the
files on disk so there is one source of truth.
