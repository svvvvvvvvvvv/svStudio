"""3D sampling-grid generation and pipeline-image reshaping.

Adobe .cube canonical order: R varies fastest, then G, then B. A flat
grid of shape ``(N**3, 3)`` lists those samples in that order. The
spektrafilm pipeline expects ``(H, W, 3)`` image input; the builder
reshapes the grid into an image, runs the pipeline, and reshapes back.

The shape choice for ``(H, W)`` doesn't affect output correctness when
``lut_mode`` is active (all spatial effects are off), but it does affect
performance — long, thin shapes can stall numba inner loops. The
default ``H = resolution, W = resolution ** 2`` is a reasonable
compromise.
