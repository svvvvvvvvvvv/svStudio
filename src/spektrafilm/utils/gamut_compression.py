"""Input gamut compression for the Hanatos 2025 spectral upsampling step.

Wide-gamut input color spaces (V-Gamut, ACEScg, AP0, …) can encode
chromaticities outside the visible spectral locus — combinations of
camera primaries that do not correspond to any physically realizable
spectrum. The Hanatos 2025 spectral upsampling is only well-defined
inside the locus; chromaticities outside it produce extrapolation noise.

This module provides:

- :class:`InputGamutCompressSpec` — the per-bundle configuration object that
  selects the algorithm and parameters.
- :func:`compress_xy` — the algorithm dispatcher; takes CIE xy values
  and returns compressed CIE xy values.
- :func:`remap_tc_lut_for_compression` — bakes the compression into a
  ``compute_hanatos2025_tc_lut``-produced LUT via remap-resample, so the
  runtime lookup path does not need to know about the compression.

The default settings use a full-range Reinhard knee
(``knee=(0.0, 1.0, 6.0)``), which applies a gentle, always-on roll-off
toward the boundary instead of leaving a hard identity region before an
abrupt shoulder. See the spektrafilm-research note
``n100_soft_input_clipping`` §5 for the rationale and comparisons.

    active :
        ``True`` applies the Reinhard-knee compression; ``False``

        (ACES RGC family). This is the production default; see n100
        §5.1 for why it won over the alternatives on smoothness probes.

        ``"oklch"`` — chroma reduction at constant Oklch (L, h) — moves

        boundary. Available for inspection / per-bundle override.
    knee :

        and ``s = limit - t``. Default ``(0.0, 1.0, 6.0)`` applies a
        soft full-range roll-off that keeps the asymptote on the locus
        boundary while avoiding a visible knee onset.

class OutputGamutCompressSpec:
    """Configuration for output gamut compression.

    Independent of :class:`InputGamutCompressSpec` (which targets the visible
    spectral locus on the input side, in chromaticity). This spec targets
    the *output primaries cube* on the output side, in destination RGB.
    Both algorithms reuse the same Reinhard knee math.

    Attributes
    ----------
    algorithm :
        ``"off"`` disables output gamut compression and passes output
        RGB through unchanged. With nothing else clipping downstream
        in the runtime, the LUT cube can then leak outside [0, 1] —
        use ``"off"`` only for diagnostic builds.

        ``"cam16ucs"`` (default) — CIECAM16 Uniform Color Space chroma reduction
        (Li & Luo 2017, CIE-endorsed). Same JpCphp polar shape as
        ``oklch`` / ``jzazbz``, but in CAM16-UCS, which models
        chromatic adaptation and viewing-condition response explicitly
        and has the cleanest constant-hue lines of the three across
        the full gamut — including the blue region where OkLab drifts.
        Viewing conditions are fixed at typical display review
        (``L_A = 64 cd/m²``, ``Y_b = 20``, Average surround). Heavier
        per-pixel than OkLab or JzAzBz (full CAM forward/inverse), so
        bake time grows ~4–6× on the compression stage; pick this when
        you want the smoothest principled chroma reduction and can
        afford the cost.

        ``"oklch"`` — perceptual-hue-preserving chroma
        reduction in OkLab. Convert output RGB → OkLab → OkLch
        (L, C, h), look up ``C_max(L, h)`` for the output color
        space's RGB cube, apply the Reinhard knee to ``C / C_max``,
        reconstruct. Preserves OkLab hue ``h`` and OkLab lightness
        ``L`` — the colorist sees the same hue at the same perceptual
        brightness, just less saturated. Default because the
        simulation's output gamut is the smooth, round-to-hexagonal
        envelope of a CMY dye set (see n110 §2), and perceptual-
        chroma reduction around a round envelope reads more smoothly
        than a per-channel knee against a triangle.

        ``"aces_rgc"`` — ACES Reference Gamut Compression v1.3 native
        form. Per-channel knee on the achromatic distance
        ``d = (max(R,G,B) - c) / max(R,G,B)``. Preserves the achromatic
        RGB mixture. This is the cinema-industry standard for output
        gamut mapping; same operation as OCIO's
        ``FixedFunctionTransform(style=ACES_GamutComp13)`` (the knee
        math is verified bit-identical in
        ``validate_compression_against_references.py``). Available as
        an opt-in for users who want behavior matching downstream
        Resolve/Nuke gamut-compress tools.

        ``"jzazbz"`` — JzCzhz chroma reduction, structurally identical
        to ``oklch`` but in the JzAzBz perceptual space (Safdar 2017)
        with the reference white luminance fixed at 100 cd/m² (SDR
        diffuse white). JzAzBz handles the blue/cyan hue region more
        gracefully than OkLab, which has a documented hue twist there
        — cyan can drift toward blue under heavy oklch compression on
        sRGB / Rec.2020 outputs. Use this if you see that artifact.
        Default knee is currently a placeholder mirroring the OkLch
        defaults; the JzAzBz Cz envelope still needs to be measured
        per output space before final defaults can be picked.

        ``"oklrab"`` — OkLab with Ottosson's 2023 rebased lightness
        ``Lr`` (a monotonic 1D remap of ``L`` so the lightness scale
        is closer to CIELAB ``L*``). Same chromatic axes ``(a, b)`` as
        ``oklch``; only the ``C_max(L, h)`` table is indexed by ``Lr``
        instead of ``L``. The knee response is then perceptually more
        uniform across light and dark regions because equal increments
        in ``Lr`` correspond to closer-to-equal perceived lightness
        changes. Same per-pixel cost as ``oklch`` (one extra scalar
        operation per sample for the ``L → Lr`` remap).

    knee :
        ``(threshold, limit, power)`` of the Reinhard knee. Default
        ``(0.0, 1.0, 6.0)`` applies a soft full-range roll-off so
        chroma starts compressing smoothly from the center instead of
        waiting for a late knee near the gamut boundary. Limit stays at
        1.0 so the asymptote sits on the cube edge and the LUT cube
        remains in [0, 1] without needing a hard clip. The knee
        operates on the unitless normalized chroma ``C / C_max`` and is
        reused unchanged across ``oklch`` and ``jzazbz``.
    lightness_compression :
        ``(threshold, limit, power)`` of a *one-sided* soft compression
        on the perceptual lightness coordinate (L for oklch/oklrab, Jz
        for jzazbz, Jp for cam16ucs), or ``None`` to disable. It rolls
        super-bright highlights smoothly down into ``[0, white]`` —
        pixels above the output whitepoint, which the chroma step alone
        cannot pull in (their ``C_max`` collapses to zero). Parameters
        are in *normalized* units where ``1.0`` = the output color
        space's perceptual white; the default ``(0.7, 1.0, 2.2)`` keeps
        the asymptote exactly at white with identity below
        ``0.7·white``.

        Crucially this is one-sided and anchored at black: an input of
        0 stays exactly 0. The previous two-sided knee mirrored the
        roll-off around mid-grey and so lifted deep shadows toward a
        non-zero floor — invisible in OkLab's cube-root lightness, but a
        visibly raised black in the PQ-based (JzAzBz) and CIECAM
        (CAM16-UCS) lightness scales, which allocate far more of their
        range to the darks. Below-black float inputs (L < 0) are left
        untouched; the simulation output is expected to stay at Y >= 0
        by physical construction. Not applied to ``algorithm="aces_rgc"``
        (no perceptual lightness axis).

    For each pixel, compute the achromatic value ``ach = max(R, G, B)``

    every channel; ``d > 1`` exactly when ``c < 0`` (the channel is
    "more saturated than the achromatic envelope"). Apply the Reinhard
    knee to each per-channel distance, then reconstruct:
    ``c' = ach * (1 - d')``.

    With the default ``limit = 1.0``, the knee asymptotes at ``d = 1``,
    so negative channels (which had ``d > 1``) are pulled to exactly
    ``c' = 0`` — the cube boundary. Positive channels inside the
    threshold ``t`` are unchanged. Hue is preserved in the colorist
    sense (the channel-mixture ratios stay coherent rather than the
    dominant-wavelength chromaticity).

    Notes on amplitude
    ------------------
    This operation does *not* touch the achromatic value itself, so
    pixels with ``ach > 1`` retain ``ach > 1`` after compression. The
    perceptual sibling algorithms (``oklch`` / ``oklrab`` / ``jzazbz``
    / ``cam16ucs``) have a companion ``lightness_compression`` that
    catches this case on the lightness axis; ``aces_rgc`` does not. Bundles
    that ship ``aces_rgc`` rely on the simulation staying in [0, 1]
    by physical construction.

    The runtime lookup path is RGB → CIE xy → tri2quad → tc → bilinear
    sample of ``tc_lut`` → raw. We do **not** want to inject a
    per-sample compression call into that path; instead we remap the
    LUT once at build time so the on-disk LUT internally absorbs the
    compression:

        new_lut[xy] = old_lut[compress(xy)]

    Concretely, for each grid cell of the new LUT we:
      1. Decode its tc index back to a CIE xy via ``_quad2tri``.
      2. Run that xy through the compressor.
      3. Re-encode the compressed xy to tc via ``_tri2quad``.
      4. Bilinearly sample the original LUT at that tc.

    Per-channel bilinear sampling via ``scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates``
    (order=1, ``mode="nearest"`` boundary so out-of-grid tc values get
    the closest-edge LUT value rather than wrapping or extrapolating
